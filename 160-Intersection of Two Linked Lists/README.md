**Constraints:**
- If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.
- The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
- You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
- Each value on each linked list is in the range ``[1, 10^9]``.
- Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.


## Answer
- Just combine two linkelist and find the same.
